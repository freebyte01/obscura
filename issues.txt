OK + in near views first should go look at and then look around

- zoom and pan does not reset on picture change
+ would be nice may be to remember zoom/pan for each pic separately

! the keys for imagedef should be based on more unique key than lowercase filename
? may be the thumbs for navigation should be possible also in a row and with relation to angle for look around and look at
+! display map pos pic preview so that it's not covering either pos or target


OK + add shift scroll to move between similar - if exists 
+ add ctrl scroll to move between same target - if exists
+ add alt scroll to move between same position - if exists


OK + similarities should have possible to define POIs 0-n for better tracking the targets an possible stabilisation (pan/scaling/rotation) of pictures for better experience when playing sequence
OK + would be nice to place POIs on any photos and assign them from the growing POI list
OK + remember last used POIS and highlight them in the menu for faster reuse 
+ might be even nice to place them on the screen where they have been used last time like a ghosts and when dragged they will be applied like from the menu  

OK + add renaming of POIs - vial LMB doubleclick 1.8
OK + add deletion of defined POIs - via rmb double click 1.8

OK + make magnifying glass for POIS placement
+ make magnify depending on speed - for precision


OK + improved latest used hotpoints, unused get forgotten as first
OK + improved chapters menu, 2 level system + hotpoints shown afterwards 
OK + improved magnifying align system to not be in the way of putting the point

++ would be nice to have associative hotpoints, which are very often shown together, even if not in hotpoints yet


++ show invisible (undefined yet) POIS from pattern match if available - predict
