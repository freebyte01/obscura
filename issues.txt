- zoom and pan does not reset on picture change
+ would be nice may be to remember zoom/pan for each pic separately
! the keys for imagedef should be based on more unique key than lowercase filename
? may be the thumbs for navigation should be possible also in a row and with relation to angle for look around and look at
+ similarities should have possible to define POIs 0-n for better tracking the targets an possible stabilisation (pan/scaling/rotation) of pictures for better experience when playing sequence
+ would be nice to place POIs on any photos and assign them from the growing POI list
+! display map pos pic preview so that it's not covering either pos or target
